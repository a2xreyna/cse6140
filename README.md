The code is ran through a Jupyter notebook.

The first two cells are for importing packages needed for the code.
The first cell is included for installing the networkx package through the Jupyter notebook kernel.

Put in the filenames of the graph file, changes file, and outfile in the cell with the lines labeled
gfile
cfile
outfile

The output file is assumed to have already been created in the directory containing all the graph output files.

After running the cell with the RunExperiments class, run the last cell which creates an instance of the RunExperiments
class and then runs the main function.

The code will produce an output in the indicated directory of output files.
